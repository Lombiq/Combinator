# Combinator Orchard module Version history



- v2.1 (Prerelease)
	- Resource sharing for multi-tenant sites
	- Fixing remote storage (like Azure blob storage) support
	- Fixing resource sets
	- Better cache events
	- Cache files are stored in a hidden media folder
	- New extension point: 3rd party modules can manipulate the Combinator cache through an event handler
	- Updating YUI Compressor
	- Ochard 1.8 and .NET 4.5 compatibility
	- Migrating settings to infoset storage
	- Refactorings and many smaller improvements and bugfixes

**Warning:** the module has new dependencies: the feature Piedone.HelpfulLibraries.Utilities in the existing dependency Piedone.HelpfulLibraries and the whole Orchard.Caching module. BEFORE UPGRADING to this version you should enable the "Utilities - Helpful Libraries" feature and install and enable the Orchard.Caching module.

Also, since this version now stores settings in the infoset instead of a separate record (what is more efficient) after upgrading your configuration will be re-set. To restore your original settings just enable the Combinator Upgrade feature. After the feature is enabled you can disable it immediately as the migration will run while the feature is being enabled.

The resource domain configuration option was changed to resource base URL. Since this is not just a name change the content of the resource domain config won't be copied over, you have to re-set is as a base URL.

- v2.0 (17.07.2013):
	- Image sprite generation support (work item #15) with exclude features and partially automatic detection whether an image is suitable for sprite generation (backgrounds with a size, position other than top-left, and repetition other than no-repeat are excluded)
	- Ability to set custom resource domain (work item #37)
	- Exposing resource processing events: this way e.g. a LESS compiler can be plugged into Combinator, so compiled stylesheets are still processed (combined and minified)
	- LESS and SASS preprocessors, contribution of Onestop Internet, Inc.
	- Better CSS processing with a real CSS parser (ExCSS)
	- Adding info comment to bundled resources (#49)
	- Displaying notification after cache clearing (work item #45)
	- Fixing problems introduced with Orchard 1.6 where the order of excluded scripts was wrong. Now scripts are handled as overridable resources like stylesheets.
	- Command line command for emptying cache
